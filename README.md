# PodSuggest Notebooks

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the capstone project I did during my fellowship at The Data Incubator. The final product of the project is called [PodSuggest](https://podsuggest.herokuapp.com) where users can find podcasts suggestions. This project consisted of three main phases:

1. Data collection and wrangling: Scraping iTunes podcast data, cleaning and organizing the dataset
2. Modeling: Using natural language processing (specifically word2vec) to convert text data to vector representations
3. Web application: Finding similar podcasts, placing data in a SQL database, creating data visualizations, and deploying the web application
